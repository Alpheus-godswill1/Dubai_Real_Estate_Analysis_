# üèôÔ∏è Dubai Real Estate Market Analysis & Price Prediction

Analyze Dubai's dynamic real estate market by exploring property transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to predict rental and sale prices. This project combines **data analytics**, **machine learning**, and **strategic investment insights** to uncover the factors driving market performance and property valuation.

## üìò Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **data-driven understanding** of Dubai‚Äôs real estate market. The workflow covers:

- Performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on property transactions to identify trends and correlations
- Investigating relationships between **property attributes** (location, size, type) and **macroeconomic indicators** (GDP, inflation, interest rates)
- Building **machine learning models** to predict property rental and sale prices
- Assessing how external economic factors influence model accuracy and prediction stability
- Providing **investment insights** and identifying **undervalued properties** with high potential returns

The top-performing models and insights will contribute to the **Dubai Real Estate dApp**, a decentralized business application offering continuous revenue opportunities for contributors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Objectives

- Conduct **comprehensive data exploration** to understand Dubai‚Äôs property market dynamics
- Identify **key drivers of price fluctuations** and how macroeconomic trends influence them
- Build **predictive models** using real estate data, and later enhance them with external datasets
- Evaluate model performance and quantify the **impact of macroeconomic integration**
- Deliver **data-backed recommendations** for real estate investors and developers
- Contribute models and insights to the **Dubai Real Estate dApp** for real-world use

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation

- Gather property transaction datasets (rental and sale records)
- Integrate macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth
- Cleanse and preprocess data: handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize **price distributions**, **seasonal patterns**, and **location-based trends**
- Explore **correlations** between property features and market movements
- Identify **investment hotspots** and **high-growth regions** within Dubai

### 3. Machine Learning Modeling

- Implement baseline models: **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- Train and test models using property features only
- Extend models with **macroeconomic variables** to assess external influence
- Compare performance using metrics such as **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R¬≤**

### 4. Evaluation & Insights

- Quantify how economic trends shape property prices
- Analyze **feature importance** to highlight major market drivers
- Derive **strategic investment insights** from model outcomes

### 5. Reporting & Visualization

- Present analytical findings with visual dashboards and reports
- Summarize key patterns influencing Dubai‚Äôs real estate market
- Recommend strategies for **investors**, **developers**, and **financial analysts**
